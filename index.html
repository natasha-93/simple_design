                     <p>I’m a travel addict. I confess. I love living in the moment and being immersed in another culture where the unexpected happens regularly. It’s hard to explain the feeling just right, but I suppose it’s the freedom I love most. Perhaps I’m just a commitment-phobe.</p>

                   <h2 class="post-title">Pleasantly Surprised by Kuta, Bali</h2>
                   <div class="post-description">
                     <p> I’ve been putting off going to Bali for quite some time now. Indonesia always appealed but I’d heard the <b>horror stories</b> of Kuta and heard too many times of it being the Australian equivalent of Magaluf. I was imagining it to be dirty, sleazy, unsafe and not cheap. So imagine my surprise when none of these were true. Perhaps my expectations were too extreme. I mean, sure, it’s not a clean, polite, very safe place, but it does have culture and character still.</p>
<p>Perhaps it helps that I stayed in a nice area away from the main strip of Legian too where locals were surprised to see tourists walking around and engaging with them. I stayed in <i>Bakung Beach Resort</i> just a kilometre away from the airport which was nice enough but not exactly what I would deem a resort. The “deluxe” room I had cost about USD $30 per night including a buffet breakfast, but I imagine everything in Kuta is pretty similar regarding value.</p>
<p>Just across the road an Indonesian woman was renting <b>motorbikes</b> for 50000IDR per day ($3.70) and they were actually pretty good and reliable. Just a typical Asian hand over your passport in exchange for the bike deal. The resort also rented bikes for 60000IDR ($4.40) per day without having to hand over your passport. I should make it clear now that I definitely wasn’t riding the bike – Kuta isn’t the best place to ride a motorbike for the first time! Whilst holding onto my boyfriend tightly we took off to explore the city. I’d heard beforehand how bad and <b>corrupt</b> the <b>police</b> were in Bali, especially at pulling over tourists on bikes, but somehow we managed to luckily avoid that aspect and only saw one harmless policeman the whole time! Still, keep your wits about you. The traffic seems to have no rules at times (even for Asia) which makes several junctions very scary and <b>dangerous</b>. I also met a girl after leaving Kuta who had several bad experiences with police which go to prove that my original expectations weren’t too far off. She had friends whose taxi was pulled over by the police, guns pointed at them, and all their money and valuables taken, so it’s not unheard of.</p>
<p>I really recommend <b>Waterbom water park</b> which is rated the best in Asia and number 3 in the world. It costs 490000IDR ($36) online, perhaps a little more on the door, and is a great day out and a nice escape from the humid dusty streets of Kuta. There’s lots of big fast slides, a lazy river you can float around in and a pool bar serving good <b>cocktails</b>, amongst lots of garden and food stalls.</p>
<p>I found the general atmosphere in Kuta a bit weird actually. It’s so <b>commercialised</b> towards Australians it’s a little stifling. Funny of course too, but the Australians for the most part love it or don’t even notice. If you want to see stereotypical Aussies, here is the place to go. The locals were all very nice and friendly and seem to be interested in having conversation especially if you’re not Australian.</p>
<p>I stayed four days in Kuta and it was plenty. There isn’t heaps to do and there’s much better places on the island of Bali. There are plenty of markets and shops but they’re all <b>overpriced</b> and you’ll have a hard time finding bargains similar to Chiang Mai or Siem Reap markets.</p>

                   <h2 class="post-title">Pretty Prague</h2>
                   <div class="post-description">
                     <p> I was actually told Prague is overrated, but mainly by people that had been and compared it to Budapest. Despite this, I immediately fell in love with the place. So many hidden walkways complete with cobbled streets and windy footpaths sure to get you lost. This is also my first time travelling by myself, so perhaps I have that excitement and energy on top of my existing impression. Either way, Prague is a winner and I shall definitely be coming back!</p>
<p>I highly recommend the <b>free walking tour</b> – I went on the afternoon ‘Royal Prague Tour’ and had an Australian guy called Ashley who now lives in the city with his Czech wife and young son. He was fantastic; the perfect mix of humour, history and culture. The tour is also a perfect head start into the city, giving pro tips and local secrets. I’m ashamed that I previously knew nothing of the country’s history but I came away with a good foundation of knowledge and understanding which altered my perception of the place and people.</p>
<p>The city is surprisingly smaller than I imagined and it is easy walking distance to everything – 45 minute max. If walkings not your thing though, the public transport is excellent with multiple trams and the metro make getting anywhere extremely easy. I stayed at <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.arpacayhostel.com%2F&t=ZmY4NTBhNjBkYjhiMzg1YTI2MTJhM2E5M2QyNjhmZDUxZmFjYjBmOSxWRzQ5OEZXUg%3D%3D"> <b>Arpacay Hostel</a></b> for €18 per night and it was located a 2 minute walk from <b>Prague Castle</b> in one of the more expensive districts, but as the city is so small it’s not an issue finding cheaper eats nearby. <b>Goulash</b> is a must here, with beer obviously. <b>Trdelnik</b>, a sweet bread like pastry, is sold throughout the city as a quick hot snack and is often topped with sugar and almonds which is worth trying!</p>
<p>I was lucky and had beautiful clear skies the whole time I was here, and there’s a perfect view over the city at night from the castle. I was also staying just a short walk from a <i>huge park</i> which is on several terraced layers of garden and woodland which offer fantastic views over the city. I frequented this park often to read a book in the sun, but its far from quiet as segway tours are extremely popular in Prague it seems!</p>
<p>The <b>architecture</b> here is what really astounded me. There’s 6 distinct styles, baroque and gothic predominantly with the occasional communist one flung in almost as a contrast. I find the buildings really tell Prague’s history. It’s amazing that the city has survived this last century with all it’s been through.</p>
<p>On my last night I splashed out and bought a box seat for Don Giovanni in the <b>Estates Theatre</b>, the only place still standing that Mozart is known to have played at. I’d never been to the theatre before and wasn’t quite sure what to expect but it was brilliant and I loved it! The theatre was beautiful, the actors and music fantastic. The only thing I found was the storyline was a bit thin to be drawn out for over 3 hours.. but overall, an amazing experience and well worth it!</p>
<p>I found <b>Czech people</b> to be friendly and very laid-back so it suited me just fine. I’ve been told there are interesting drug laws here where it’s only illegal to be caught selling or buying but not possession. Because of this and possibly the recent erratic history, apparently 70-80% of people here get high often which I could tell just by walking down most streets! I was also surprisingly mistaken several times for a local Czech woman which was a massive confidence boost both because (1) Czech are renowned for being beautiful right?! and (2) I obviously fit in and look like I know what I’m doing more than I think! I’m not a huge fan of the “tourist look” and love the idea of blending into a culture so this was great!</p>
